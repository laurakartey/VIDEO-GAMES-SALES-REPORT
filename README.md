# VIDEO-GAMES-SALES-REPORT
This project is an analysis of video games sales report across different regions and genres

Platform Sales:
	
The Nintendo DS (DS) shows a significantly higher total global sales volume compared to other platforms like PS3, X360, and PS, indicating its popularity.  The PlayStation 4 (PS4), despite being a newer console compared to others like the PS3 and Xbox 360, shows relatively low total sales, suggesting a shift in market dynamics or consumer preferences during its time.

Top Games Performance:
   
'Grand Theft Auto V' published by Take-Two Interactive has a notably high global sales figure, which dominates other titles, highlighting its success across various platforms.  Sports titles like FIFA 15, 16, and 17 consistently perform well, indicating a stable fan base and consistent year-on-year demand.

Sales Distribution by Genre:
   
Action and Sports genres dominate the global sales by a large margin, showing the consumer preference towards these genres. Simulation and Platform genres show relatively low sales figures, possibly pointing to niche markets or lesser mainstream appeal.

Top Publishersâ€™ Impact:
   
Nintendo and Electronic Arts stand out with significantly higher global sales compared to other publishers like Activision and Sony Computer Entertainment, suggesting strong brand influence and a successful portfolio of games. The graph showing the number of games sold by each publisher aligns with the sales figures, indicating that higher volumes of titles released correlate strongly with total sales.

Global Sales Distribution:
    
North America and Europe contribute significantly to the global sales, which may reflect the higher spending power or a larger gamer base in these regions. The decline or lower sales in other regions might highlight underpenetrated markets or challenges like distribution or localization.

Strategy
Platform Strategy: Marketing can be done for games that are lagging behind on various platforms.

Genre Popularity: Future game development should favour genres that are showing strong sales performance to optimize revenue and some games lagging can be modified to fit this technology world.

Regional Focus: There could be an opportunity to increase focus on regions like Europe which are showing strong growth, or to develop strategies to boost sales in underperforming regions.
